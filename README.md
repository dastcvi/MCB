This repository contains the motor control board software for LASP Strateole 2 reeldown instruments. It is structured as an Arduino library for the Teensy 3.6 Arduino-compatible board based on an ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller.

There are additional libraries upon which this one depends, but note that not all of these are maintained on my GitHub.
